# create-a-Face-Detection-Android-App-using-Machine-Learning-KIT-on-Firebase
Firebase ML KIT aims to make machine learning more accessible, by providing a range of pre-trained models that can use in the iOS and Android apps. Let’s use ML Kit’s Face Detection API which will identify faces in photos. By the end of this article, we’ll have an app that can identify faces in an image, and then display information about these faces, such as whether the person is smiling, or has their eyes closed with wonderful GUI.
